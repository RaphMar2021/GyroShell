# GyroShell
A shell for Windows 11 (and maybe 10) that aims to create a much nicer and more functional shell. Fully written in C# and WASDK.

# Building
To build GyroShell, you're gonna need a few things. First, you need to have Visual Studio 2022 with WASDK C# installed. Use git to clone this repository, then open the solution in Visual Studio. After that, you're ready to build!

# Installing
To install GyroShell, just download the app package from releases and install the certificate to "Local Machine > Trusted People". This is because my app package is not signed for the store, and needs to be trusted by the certificate. After that, just launch GyroShell and it should take place of your current shell!
